0:00
even though the stripe API documentation
0:02
is longer than Lord of the Rings there
0:04
is a very easy and fast way to set up
0:06
monthly recurring payments for your
0:08
software in this video we're going to uh
0:10
create a little pricing table for people
0:12
to choose monthly or yearly uh
0:14
subscriptions we're going to deal with
0:15
stri web hooks to make sure that we
0:17
Grant or revok access to users based on
0:20
their current subscription status and
0:21
we're going to let your users manage
0:23
their subscription whether they want to
0:24
update their credit cards upgrade or
0:25
downgrade their plans or even cancel it
0:27
and you'll see that we'll be able to do
0:29
this with just a few dozen lines of code
0:31
for the tech tack I'm going to be using
0:32
just a little bit of react as well as an
0:34
API endpoint uh through the nextjs API
0:37
route but you can use anything else like
0:39
for instance an Express server and
0:41
that's pretty much it if you're new here
0:43
my name is Mark I have built over 20
0:44
products on the internet from AI tools
0:46
habit tracker a few useless products and
0:49
some software that I grew to a couple
0:51
thousand in mostly recing revenue and
0:53
this is the video I wish I found when I
Subscription 101
0:55
got started first let's start with a
0:56
quick overview of what we're going to
0:57
build on the client side so your
1:00
customers they will be able to select a
1:02
yearly or monthly plan and subscribe to
1:04
one of them by entering the credit card
1:05
details this is going to go straight to
1:07
stripe create the subscriptions create
1:08
the customers and STP is going to update
1:10
our API through web books tell us
1:13
whether or not we should give access to
1:14
the user again for the API I'm using
1:16
nextjs but you can use pretty much
1:17
anything you want like Express and then
1:19
once the customer has access they will
1:21
be able to manage their subscription
1:22
with the strap customer portal so if
1:24
they want to upgrade the subscription
1:26
download the invoice or uh even cancel
1:28
it and it's going to update stripe and
1:30
stripe is going to let us know again
1:31
through a webbook whether we should
1:33
update or not the user in the database
Accepting payments
1:35
before we start coding let's set up the
1:37
strip account so make sure you are in
1:39
test mode and then go to your product
1:41
catalog and there you will be able to
1:42
add a new product you can call it the
1:44
way you want I'm going to call it hello
1:46
YouTube and set up whatever recurring
1:48
payment you want I'm going to start with
1:50
a monthly recurring payment at $19 it's
1:52
going to create the product you can
1:54
click on it and you will see your
1:56
pricing plan here start by creating uh a
1:59
payment link so just click that button
2:01
make sure you check this option right
2:03
here if you work with uh European
2:05
businesses that would let them input
2:07
their tax ID so they have invoices with
2:09
their vat for instance and on the after
2:11
payment page you want to replace with a
2:14
custom message that says go back to your
2:16
dashboard and refresh it to
2:20
unlock the services thanks for your
2:23
trust you can create the link and you
2:26
will create another link for this
2:29
product so go back to your product
2:31
catalog select the product you just
2:32
created and we're going to create a
2:34
yearly plan so we're going to add
2:35
another price and we're going to say
2:37
let's say
2:37
$99 per year and create the price and
2:42
we're going to do the exact same thing
2:43
we're going to create a payment link
2:45
we're going to allow businesses to input
2:47
their V number and in the after payment
2:49
page you can copy past the exact same
2:51
message we said earlier make sure to say
2:52
to your user to refresh your product
2:55
page so that they get the latest data
2:57
from your API and then create the link
2:59
and and you're going to end up having
3:01
another payment link for the yearly plan
3:02
for each of the pricing we created we're
3:04
going to did two things per pricing
3:06
we're going to did the price ID right
3:08
here as well as the payment link so the
3:11
URL that you can copy right here now
3:13
we're going to code a little pricing
3:15
table where people can choose between
3:17
paying monthly or paying the yearly and
3:19
we're going to see what happens when we
3:20
click on this link for that I have spin
3:22
up a little next year project so I have
3:24
this uh page this homepage whatever it
3:27
is with a component called pricing the
3:29
pricing component is important there are
3:30
two things going on first there is this
3:32
array of plans and you can see we have
3:34
two objects this one is the monthly plan
3:36
and this one is the yearly plan we have
3:39
uh these data for visualization on the
3:41
table component and we have the payment
3:44
link uh URL that we copy past from
3:46
stripe earlier as well as the price ID
3:48
that we copy pasted earlier and because
3:50
stripe has a test and a production mode
3:52
I'm also using process.of not not
3:54
environment equal developments when I'm
3:56
testing on my computer and I would set
3:57
this up to the actual production price
4:00
when I go live it's important to export
4:02
this constant here because we're going
4:03
to be using it later for the web hook
4:05
all right now we have the components the
4:07
component is very simple it's mostly UI
4:09
with the little use states to uh swap
4:12
between different type of plans the
4:13
yearly and the monthly ones there's
4:15
nothing fancy here is just a purely
4:17
visual what matters here is what happens
4:19
when people click on the Subscribe
4:20
button you can see we are going to open
4:23
a new window and we are going to direct
4:24
the user to the payment link URL and
4:27
we're going to prefill the email with
4:29
with prefield email using the user email
4:33
for this part of the video I assume that
4:35
you already have some kind of
4:36
authentification system I'm using next
4:39
oath for that as well as a mongodb
4:41
database but you can use literally
4:43
anything you want as long as the user is
4:44
authentification you can pass the user
4:46
email after the pre-filled email query
4:49
and is going to prepopulate the user
4:50
email and if you don't have some
4:52
authentification in place already at the
4:53
end of the video I'm going to ver a use
4:55
case where you can start charging
4:56
subscriptions to user that is not even
4:58
authenticated so now now when the user
5:00
click on the Subscribe link is going to
5:01
open the payment link and it's going to
5:04
prefill the user email so we can know
5:06
who uh paid for this uh membership and
5:09
then we're going to input some fake
5:11
dummy data and see what's happening Mark
5:13
and we're going to say okay and then
5:15
we're going to back to stripe and if we
5:18
refresh the page it is this one this
5:20
customer was just created the
5:21
subscription is active on stripe and the
5:23
customer paid I already have a bunch of
5:25
other payments because I'm testing it
5:26
with my computer but normally you should
5:28
have subscription that is active right
5:30
here and on the confirmation payment
5:31
page it says go back to your dashboard
5:33
and refresh it to unlock the service
Grant/revoke access
5:34
okay now we need to update users in our
5:36
database to know whether or not they
5:38
have access and for that we're going to
5:39
use stripe web hooks so go to your
5:41
developer tabs and you're going to need
5:43
two things first you're going to need
5:45
your API key so you can reveal your test
5:47
API key the private one and you're going
5:49
to copy paste it in your project you can
5:51
call your key whatever you want I call
5:52
it stripe secret key and then just pass
5:54
the key right after that because I'm
5:55
using nextjs those are private and they
5:58
will never be shared with the client but
5:59
if if you're using react you want to
6:01
make sure that you only share those API
6:02
keys on your back end then go to the
6:05
webbook part and you're going to say you
6:06
want to add a local event listener
6:08
you're going to type this in your
6:10
terminal so stripe login is going to
6:12
prompt you to log to stripe and once
6:14
you're good with that do not run the
6:15
common number two I'll show you the one
6:17
we're going to be using so we are going
6:18
to create a second terminal I usually
6:20
put it uh on the right side of it and
6:22
then you're going to use this common
6:24
stripe listen-- forward to Local Host
6:27
the port you're using usually 3,000 I
6:29
call mine /i/ web hook slst stripe just
6:33
copy paste this and press enter and it's
6:35
going to set up a little listener on
6:37
your computer and you're going to get a
6:39
webbook secret signing key like this one
6:42
and you can copy paste it in an
6:43
environment variable called strip
6:45
webbook Secrets the webbook secret is
6:47
just a random number to make sure that
6:49
the calls we receive from stripe are
6:51
actually coming from them and not from
6:53
someone else now that we have a stripe
6:54
local event listeners everything that
6:56
happens on your stripe test account will
6:59
arrive on your computer and you will be
7:01
notified in this console so if I try to
7:03
pay again here you will see that you
7:05
will get notified but it also works if I
7:06
do actions directly on stripe for
7:08
instance let's say I create a fake
7:10
payment of $1 I create the payment and
7:12
you will see that I will be notified
7:14
here in my console I receive some events
7:16
from stripe like charge succeeded
7:18
payment intend succeeded and a bunch of
7:20
other events and this is how we're going
7:21
to update users in the database to know
7:23
whether or not they have access to your
7:25
product for that you're going to need a
7:26
little API endpoint for me as I'm using
7:28
njs I I created a/ API folder and in the
7:32
webbook folder in the stripe folder I
7:34
created a route where I have my API
7:37
Handler if you're using Express for
7:39
instance uh stripe has a nice
7:40
documentation they will show you exactly
7:42
how you do that if you go back to that
7:44
developer uh page they will show you how
7:46
to set up your Express server the
7:48
beginning of the code here does not
7:49
really matter you see we pull the stripe
7:51
webbook secret and the stripe secret key
7:53
here and then we're going to verify that
7:55
the webbook is actually coming from
7:57
stripe and then the important part that
7:58
we're going to in this video is the
8:00
events we receive and so we have a big
8:02
switch and we're going to iterate over
8:04
each events that we receive and decide
8:06
which actions to take and for us for our
8:08
simple use case we only have two events
8:10
that we really care about we're using
8:12
the stripe node.js package in order to
8:14
uh query and interact with the stripe
8:16
API so the first thing we do is we
8:18
actually get the session object from
8:20
that customer we're going to extract the
8:22
customer ID we're going to get some more
8:24
information about the customer we're
8:26
also going to retrieve the price ID from
8:28
the session so if you remember earlier
8:30
the price ID is the little thing we copy
8:32
pasted and then we're going to iterate
8:33
over the plans our plans if you remember
8:35
in our uh pricing component we set up an
8:38
array with two objects each of them have
8:40
the price ID and that's why it's
8:42
important so that we can get the plan
8:44
here if there is no plan it's probably
8:46
some uh bugs or mistakes so we just want
8:47
to break the loop and move on and then
8:49
we're going to either create the
8:51
customer or update the person if they
8:53
already exist for instance if a customer
8:55
paid and then cancel the subscriptions
8:57
and then 3 months later came back and
8:59
paid again we don't want to create a new
9:00
customer we want to update them so it's
9:02
going to check the customer email so the
9:04
email that the customer inputed in this
9:07
field here and we're going to search if
9:09
that customer exist in our database I'm
9:12
using mongodb this is how I query it it
9:14
would be the same for uh anything else
9:15
you're using if there is no user we want
9:17
to create the the person so we want to
9:19
uh we get their normally we get their
9:21
name from the stripe checkout uh we also
9:23
get the email and we get the customer ID
9:25
it's a unique identifier in stripe that
9:27
we're going to reuse later and then
9:29
going to update the user um there are
9:31
two things we want to update we want to
9:32
say the price ID so they subscribe for
9:34
that monthly or that yearly plan and we
9:36
also want to update a some kind of
9:38
Boolean for me I call it as access if
9:41
it's true the user has paid if it's
9:42
false the user hasn't paid we save the
9:44
user and then we're done one thing I
9:46
also recommend you here is to sending a
9:47
little extra email like welcome to your
9:50
product name here is your logging link
9:51
or something like this to make sure that
9:53
if the user move on after paying that
9:55
they have some kind of backup on their
9:56
email uh box and the second event that's
9:59
is called customer subscription deleted
10:01
so stripe will create a subscription
10:03
life cycle for you when the customer
10:05
start to pay for um that monthly or
10:07
yearly membership and they will send you
10:08
events frequently uh if the user has
10:10
paid the invoice if the subscription has
10:12
renewed cancelled uh upgraded whatever
10:14
you only want to listen to the
10:15
subscription deleted this is fired when
10:18
the customer cancel the subscription and
10:20
they reach the end of their billing
10:21
cycle this is usually the time where you
10:23
want to stop providing access to your
10:26
customers so for that we're going to get
10:28
back the subscription from stripe we're
10:29
going to first retrieve it with the ID
10:31
and thanks to that object we know uh the
10:34
customer ID unique identifier for the
10:36
customer we're going to retrieve it from
10:38
our database this time and we're going
10:39
to turn off their Boolean and save the
10:41
user and this is pretty much all you
10:43
need to have a subscription that either
10:44
grants or revoke access to your
10:46
customers there are also some nice tripe
10:48
even that I'm going to share with you
10:49
just in case you have some more uh
10:51
complex or you want to do some marketing
10:53
things for instance the stripe checkout
10:55
expired event is when the customer don't
10:57
pay and they leave the checkout page you
10:59
can sometimes access their emails and
11:01
this is when you want to tell them like
11:02
hey you did not make a purchase here is
11:04
a 20% discount for next checkout or
11:06
something like that the customer
11:07
subscription updated is fired every time
11:10
there is some events like the
11:11
subscription is renewed every month
11:13
you'll receive an event normally you
11:15
don't need to do anything here because
11:17
we just revoke the access when the
11:19
subscription is actually deleted the
11:21
invoice payment failed event is fired
11:23
after a customer was charged but it was
11:26
not successful let's say your customers
11:27
will have money on the bank account then
11:29
you will receive this event in some
11:31
cases you might want to block
11:33
subscription right away but usually it's
11:35
quite friendly to wait until the end of
11:37
the billing cycle to stop granting them
11:39
access so you would normally don't do
11:41
anything here unless you want to stop
11:43
the subscription right away after a fail
11:44
payment and finally the invoice paid
11:47
event is fired after the opposite
11:49
happens so when a customer credit card
11:51
is charged if you're using the previous
11:53
even to stop giving access as soon as
11:56
the payment is failed then in the
11:57
invoice paid you might want to have the
11:59
opposite effect which means that you get
12:01
the customer and you give them access
12:03
back every time they make a successful
12:05
payment but again in 99% of the cases
12:07
you only need those two events all right
12:09
let's see what we have now so we can
12:11
create any subscription I'm going to go
12:12
for the yearly plan and I'm going to
12:14
input some Demi data the test credit
12:16
card is 424242 we're going to be in 2025
12:20
and I'm going to say uh I'm going to be
12:22
John this time and then I can subscribe
12:24
to the yearly plan in my backand I
12:26
should receive the stripe events right
12:29
here here uh one of those events is
12:30
supposed to be called checkout session
12:32
completed and this is where we're going
12:33
to create our user in the database we're
12:36
going to double check my mongodb making
12:37
sure that it was actually created there
12:39
we go when I refresh I see the user so I
12:41
have those information so the name and
12:43
the email provided during the checkout
12:45
as well as some stripe uh information
12:47
like the customer ID and the price ID
12:49
and we can see that the user has access
12:51
to the product so we can give him or her
12:54
uh probably him in this case this is
12:55
John access if we double check in stripe
12:57
and refresh the customer tab we will see
13:00
we should have a new customer created
13:02
called John here we go and he has an
13:05
active subscription now I want to test
13:07
if the revok access is also working so
13:09
I'm going to cancel the subscription
13:11
immediately and on my backand I should
13:13
also receive some new events somewhere
13:15
here actually I received it already it
13:17
was really fast customer subscription
13:18
deleted which is the second event we're
13:20
listening to this one which normally
13:23
should update our database and remove
13:25
access from the user we're going to
13:26
double check that in mongodb again
13:28
refresh and and we can see the user uh
13:30
does not have access anymore so this is
Manage subscriptions
13:33
working okay now we want to let users
13:35
manage their subscription so either
13:36
upgrade plan cancel change download the
13:38
invoice change your credit cards and all
13:40
that things for that go back to your
13:41
product catalog and pick the monthly
13:43
plan and you're going to say in the
13:45
upsell category say upsell to the yearly
13:48
plan and then in the search tab type
13:50
customer portal and in setting Billings
13:53
customer portal you should have this
13:54
page um I think I turned mine on already
13:57
uh there might be a button to turn it on
13:58
in the subscription part here you will
14:00
want to uh select the products that
14:03
customers can um subscribe or not so you
14:05
will find your product here the yearly
14:07
plan and the monthly plan save the
14:09
changes and you're going to copy the
14:12
link that is right here and then in your
14:14
code so this is my uh homepage or
14:15
whatever user dashboard page I created a
14:18
simple react component button customer
14:20
portal in this button I just get the
14:22
user session so I know their emails and
14:24
I also have the link I just copied from
14:26
the customer portal and when the user is
14:29
actually authenticated I just have a
14:31
link that goes to that customer portal
14:33
link plus I add the as before for the
14:36
checkout the prefill email query with
14:38
the user email in the end and then when
14:40
I click on it on the user side it's
14:42
going to open the striped customer
14:44
portal with the email prefilled from
14:46
here customer can receive an email to
14:48
log to their customer portal and manage
14:51
everything so this is my Gmail if I
14:53
click here is going to open my stripe
14:55
customer portal and then the customer
14:56
will receive an email it looks like this
14:58
and when they click on it they will
15:00
access to their uh billing portal where
15:02
they can update their plan or cancel it
15:04
as well as changing their payment method
15:06
adding new credit cards building
15:07
information invoice history and a bunch
15:09
of other cool stuff a few things once
Production setup
15:11
you're ready to go to production uh go
15:12
to your developer tab turn off the test
15:15
mode part and copy your actual
15:16
production API key and in the webbook
15:19
tabs you will have to add your own uh
15:21
website so add an endpoints your domain
15:24
name/ API webook stripe and add the
15:27
events you want to listen to Because by
15:29
default they're known so you want to
15:30
listen checkout completed this one as
15:32
well as the subscription deleted here we
15:35
go you can add events and at the end
15:37
point and you should be good to go in
Pre-signup checkout
15:39
the case you want to start charging a
15:41
subscription before logging users in
15:43
which I think is a really good way to
15:44
increase your coners rate you want to
15:45
make sure that first on your payment
15:48
link confirmation page you tell people
15:50
to actually follow the instruction
15:52
received by email and in your webbook
15:53
Handler you want to make sure that at
15:55
the end after creating the user it
15:57
actually sends an email to the user with
15:59
a link for them to log in if you already
Thoughts on subscriptions...
16:02
have a business that's processing couple
16:04
thousands of dollars on monthly recuring
16:05
revenue and you need some very specific
16:07
granular control you can try to create
16:09
customer portals and checkout session
16:11
using the API but if you're getting
16:12
started this setup will work for 99% of
16:15
the cases and actually if you're also
16:16
getting started I recommend you to play
16:18
around with onetime payments of their
16:20
subscriptions the strip setup is exactly
16:22
the same as I just showed you but you'll
16:24
see it's much easier to sell a software
16:26
for $99 lifetime payment than it is to
16:28
to sell a $19 monthly recording payments
16:32
and when you're getting started you'll
16:33
see it's very important you start making
16:34
a little bit of money at the beginning
16:36
because you will keep you motivated and
16:38
one time payments are much easier to
16:39
sell if you want to understand the logic
16:41
behind this I'll share a video around
16:42
here to explain that that's it for this
16:44
video if you liked it you can like it if
16:46
you enjoy it you can subscribe to the
16:47
channel that will really means a lot and
16:48
until the next one I hope you just ship
16:50
it
